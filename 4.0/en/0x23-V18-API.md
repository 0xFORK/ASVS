# V18: API and Web Service Verification Requirements

## Control Objective

Ensure that a verified application that uses a server-side API (commonly using JSON or XML or GraphQL) has:

* Adequate authentication, session management and authorization of all web services.
* Input validation of all parameters that transit from a lower to higher trust level.

Previous requirements in this standard apply to APIs as well (access control, security in transit, etc.)

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE | CWSS |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---:| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **18.1** | Verify that the same encoding is used between the client and the server. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.2** | Verify that, if REST is used, the HTTP Methods are a valid choice for the user, or action. |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.3** | Verify that access to administration and management functions within the Web Service Application is limited to web service administrators. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.4** | Verify that XML or JSON schema is in place and verified before accepting input. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.5** | Verify that REST services are protected from Cross-Site Request Forgery via the use of at least one or more of the following: double submit cookie pattern, CSRF nonces, ORIGIN request header checks, and referrer request header checks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd |
| **18.6** | Verify that REST services explicitly check the incoming Content-Type to be the expected one, such as application/xml or application/JSON. |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.7** | Verify that the message payload is signed to ensure reliable transport between client and service, using JSON Web Signing or WS-Security for SOAP requests. |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd |
| **18.8** | Verify API URLs do not expose sensitive information, such as the API key, session tokens etc. |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.9** | Verify that authorization decisions are made at both the URI and resource level, not just at the resource level. |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.10** | If GraphQL is used, to prevent DoS as a result of expensive, nested queries, query whitelisting or a combination of depth limiting and amount limiting should be used. For more advanced scenarios, query cost analysis should be used. |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.11** | If GraphQL is used, authorization logic should be implemented at the business logic layer instead of the GraphQL layer. |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.12** | If no access control is present, verify that the REST service isn't susceptible to excessive calls, which could lead to increased overhead or CPU/bandwidth bills. A potential solution could be API keys, or implementing anti-automation techniques such as rate limiting, or quotas. |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd | 
| **18.13** | Verify that requests containing unexpected or missing content types are rejected with appropriate headers (HTTP response status 406 Unacceptable or 415 Unsupported Media Type). |  | ✓ | ✓ | tbd | tbd |
