# Preface

Welcome to the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) version 3.0. The ASVS is a community-effort to establish a framework of security requirements and controls that focus on normalising the functional and non-functional security controls required when designing, developing and testing modern web applications.
ASVS v3.0 is a culmination of community effort and industry feedback. In this release, we felt it was important to qualify the experiences of real world use cases relating to ASVS adoption. This will help newcomers to the standard plan their adoption of the ASVS, whilst assisting existing companies in learning from the experience of others.

We expect that there will most likely never be 100% agreement on this standard. Risk analysis is always subjective to some extent, which creates a challenge when attempting to generalize in a one size fits all standard. However, we hope that the latest updates made in this version are a step in the right direction, and respectfully enhance the concepts introduced in this important industry standard.

## Whatâ€™s new in 3.0?

In version 3.0, we have added several new sections, including Configuration, Web Services, Modern (Client) based applications, and IoT Devices to make the Standard more applicable to modern applications, which are commonly responsive applications, with an extensive HTML5 front end or mobile client that calls a common set of RESTful web services using SAML authentication. 

We have also de-duplicated the standard, for example, to ensure that a mobile developer does not need to re-test the same items multiple times. 

We have provided a mapping to the CWE common weakness enumeration (CWE) dictionary. The CWE mapping can be used to identify information such as likelihood of exploitation, consequence of a successful exploitation and broadly speaking to gain insight on what could go wrong if a security control is not used or implemented effectively and how to mitigate the weakness. 

Lastly, we reached out to the community and held peer review sessions at AppSec EU 2015 and a final working session at AppSec USA 2015 to include a massive amount of community feedback. During peer review, if edits to the meaning of a control changed substantially, we created a new control and deprecated the old one. We have deliberately chosen to not reuse any deprecated control requirements, as this could be a source of confusion. We have provided a comprehensive mapping of what has changed in Appendix A. 

Taken together, v3.0 is the single largest change to the Standard in its history. We hope that you find the update to the standard useful, and use it in ways we can only imagine.
