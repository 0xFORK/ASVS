# V20: Internet of Things Verification Requirements

This section contains controls that are Embedded/IoT device specific. These controls must be taken in conjunction with all other sections of the relevant ASVS Verification Level.

## Control Objective

Embedded/IoT devices should:

* Have the same level of security controls within the device as found in the server, by enforcing security controls in a trusted environment.
* Sensitive data stored on the device should be done so in a secure manner using hardware backed storage such as secure elements.
* All sensitive data transmitted from the device should utilize transport layer security.
